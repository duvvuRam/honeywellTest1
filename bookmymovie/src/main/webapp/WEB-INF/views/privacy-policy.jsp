The third-party social media site will give us certain information about you. This could include your name and email address. Your activities on our sites and apps may be posted to the social media platforms.
					<br><br>
					We use information as disclosed and described here.

These might be our own offers or products, or third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting. Or, for example, if you buy tickets from us we'll enroll you in our newsletter. We may use push notifications and your location information on our mobile apps to send you alerts regarding local events.
					<br><br>
					We use information to send you transactional communications. For example, we might send you emails about your account or a ticket purchase. We might also contact you about this policy or our website terms.

Our partners use the information we give them as described in their privacy policies. You should read the policies to learn how they treat your information.
					<br><br>
					We may share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves. For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may also share it if a government agency or investigatory body requests, or we might also share information when we are investigating potential fraud. This might include fraud we think has happened during a sweepstakes or promotion.

					<br><br>
					You can opt out of receiving our marketing emails. To stop receiving our promotional emails, follow the instructions in any promotional message you get from us. Your device settings should provide you with instructions on how to turn off push notifications. It may take about ten days to process your request. Even if you opt out of getting marketing messages, we will still be sure to send you transactional messages. For example, we may still contact you about your orders.
					<br><br>
					You can modify information you have given us. To correct or delete information or update account settings, log into your account and follow the instructions. We make changes as soon as we can. This information may stay in our backup files. If we cannot make the changes you want, we will let you know and explain why. If you contact us requesting access to your information, we will respond within 30 days.
